# Transmission_Line_Designer
“Design and Implementation of a Power Line Designing Software” as my final project in Bachelor program.
This is an old project and I'm not even sure if it is compatible with the new systems.
I collaborated with a [colleague](https://github.com/ka7eh) on this project for about 8 months and after cooperating with two major companies, 
the final project was honored with an excellent score of 20 out of 20 by the jury committee.
Part of this project was then accepted and published as a paper entitled “Simulation of Radio-TV Interferences in Power Transmission Lines.”
in the 21st [Tehran International Power System Conference](http://psc-ir.com/en/).

This Software calculates the electrical parameters of various High-voltage overhead transmission lines.
